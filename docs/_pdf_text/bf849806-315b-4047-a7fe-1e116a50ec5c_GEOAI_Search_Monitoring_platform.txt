🌐  Business Layer Overview
The platform serves three main user personas:
 Marketing & Growth Teams → want visibility and brand share in AI search.
 SEO & Content Teams → need actionable fixes to improve citation rates.
 Executives & Analysts → want measurable KPIs, ROI, and competitive 
advantage.
Weʼll break each layer into how users perform tasks, business benefits, and 
technical architecture.
