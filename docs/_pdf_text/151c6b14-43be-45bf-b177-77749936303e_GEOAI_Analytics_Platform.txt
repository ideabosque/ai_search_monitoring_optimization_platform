🌐  1. Discover & Plan — Choosing What to Watch
This is where users decide what kinds of questions they want the system to ask 
the AI search engines.
Prompt & Topic Manager
What users do:
You tell the system what questions people might ask in ChatGPT, Perplexity, or 
Googleʼs AI Overview — like “Who are the best suppliers of ashwagandha?ˮ 
or “Where can I buy bulk protein powder?ˮ
You group these into topics Herbal Ingredients, Sports Nutrition, etc.) and set 
how often to check — every day, week, or month. You can also add competitor 
brands to compare against.
What happens in the background:
The system schedules automatic “queriesˮ to those AI platforms and keeps 
track of costs and frequency.
Why it matters:
You get to focus on the conversations that matter most to your business — 
instead of tracking thousands of random prompts.
🔎  2. Monitor & Understand — Seeing How You Appear 
in AI Results
This part automatically checks how AI tools talk about your brand or your 
competitors.

Engine Connectors
What users see:
You open a dashboard showing results from different AI engines ChatGPT, 
Perplexity, Gemini, etc.). Each question shows the full AI answer, which links 
were cited, and even a screenshot for proof.
Behind the scenes:
The platform automatically “asksˮ these questions to each AI engine, saves 
the text of the answer, and captures the list of links or brand mentions.
Benefit:
You can clearly see if your brand is being mentioned or ignored — and how 
that changes over time.
Parser & Normalizer
What users see:
All answers look consistent, no matter which AI engine they came from.
Behind the scenes:
Each engineʼs answer format is different, so the system cleans and 
standardizes them.
Example: ChatGPT might show “sourcesˮ while Perplexity lists “links.ˮ The 
platform turns them into one consistent format so you can compare fairly.
Benefit:
You get one clean dashboard instead of manually decoding different result 
layouts.
Brand & Competitor Resolver
What users do:
You add your companyʼs domains (like i n g r e d i e n t s o n l i n e . c o m ) and any brand 
nicknames.
Behind the scenes:

2

The system checks every link and text mention to figure out which brand it 
belongs to — even if itʼs a subdomain or product name.
Benefit:
You know exactly who is winning attention in AI results — you, a competitor, or 
a marketplace.
Scoring & Trends
What users see:
A clear “report cardˮ of your brandʼs presence:
Answer Share — how often your brand is mentioned in answers.
Citation Share — how often your siteʼs links are cited.
Sentiment — if mentions are positive or negative.
Prominence — whether youʼre mentioned first or last.
Behind the scenes:
The system crunches daily data and turns it into visual trends and alerts.
Benefit:
You can easily spot if your visibility is improving, stable, or dropping — without 
reading every single AI answer.
⚙  3. Optimize & Execute — Taking Action
Hereʼs where teams use insights to improve how their brand appears in AI search.
GEO Audit Crawler
What users do:
Run a “site checkˮ on your website. The tool scans your pages and lists what 
could help AI models understand and cite you better — like missing FAQ 
schema, unclear titles, or lack of structured data.
Behind the scenes:
GEO / AI Anal y tics Plat f or m
3

It automatically browses your website (like Google does) and tests for specific 
technical and content issues that affect AI visibility.
Benefit:
Instead of guessing, you get a to-do list with the exact changes that could 
make your pages more “AI-friendly.ˮ
Insights & Action Center
What users do:
The system gives you prioritized suggestions like:
“Add an FAQ block to your ashwagandha page — itʼs missing on competitor 
pages cited by ChatGPT.ˮ
You can generate an outline or send the task directly to your content team.
Behind the scenes:
It connects GEO results, competitor data, and your website audit to suggest 
the highest-impact actions.
Benefit:
You focus on fixes that actually move the needle, not on random SEO tweaks.
LLM Emulator (Test Harness)
What users do:
Before publishing changes, you can test two content versions (say, old vs new 
product page) and see which one AI engines are more likely to quote.
Behind the scenes:
The system uses an AI model that imitates ChatGPTʼs reasoning style. It “asksˮ 
your target questions and measures which page seems more authoritative.
Benefit:
You can test content like youʼd test ads — before spending weeks waiting for 
results.

Experiment Lab
What users do:
Launch small real-world tests — for example, change content on half your 
pages and keep the other half as control.
After a few weeks, see if your brand shows up more often in AI answers.
Behind the scenes:
The platform tracks before-and-after visibility and calculates whether the lift is 
statistically significant.
Benefit:
You prove which optimizations really increase your AI visibility — with hard 
data.
📣  4. Communicate & Automate — Staying in the Loop
Alerts & Digests
What users do:
Subscribe to instant alerts or weekly summaries.
Example: “Your Answer Share dropped 10% on Gemini this week — 
competitors gained ground.ˮ
Behind the scenes:
The system constantly checks for sudden changes or trends and sends alerts 
via email or Slack.
Benefit:
You never miss an opportunity or threat — itʼs like a watchdog for your AI 
visibility.
Dashboard & Analyst Workbench
What users do:

Explore data interactively — filter by engine, topic, or date; annotate key 
events; export slides for reports.
Behind the scenes:
The dashboard pulls from analytics databases and adds saved “viewsˮ for 
regular tracking.
Benefit:
Everyone — executives, marketers, or SEO  can understand performance at 
a glance.
API & Integrations
What users do:
Connect your GEO data to other systems like Google Data Studio, HubSpot, or 
your internal BI tool.
Behind the scenes:
The API provides read-only access to answers, citations, and trends.
Webhooks can push new loss/gain alerts automatically.
Benefit:
GEO data becomes part of your companyʼs overall marketing intelligence.
🧱  5. Admin & Governance — Keeping It Reliable and 
Secure
Tenancy & Billing
What users do:
Admins manage workspaces, invite teammates, assign roles, and monitor 
usage or costs.
Behind the scenes:
Subscription tiers control how many prompts and engines each workspace 
can track.

Benefit:
Clear visibility of usage and spend across teams.
Compliance & Observability
What users do:
Compliance officers review data storage rules and retention policies; 
engineers monitor uptime and errors.
Behind the scenes:
The system encrypts stored data, logs every action, and automatically 
removes old results after set retention periods.
Benefit:
Enterprise-grade reliability and legal peace of mind.
